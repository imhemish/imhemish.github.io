# About Me
Hey, there! I'm Hemish. I am an organized mess of some random molecules existing to form something called 'life' in human form. This life was born in [Haryana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) and this life is currently 17 years old (though according to science, almost all my cells have been replaced by new cells, so am I me even?).

# My love for languages
I also like to learn languages, be it human or computer ones. The languages I know both to read and write are [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language), [Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi), [Punjabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language) ([gurmukhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurmukhi)), [Urdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu). I am learning [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language). One of language I know little and can only speak is [Saraiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraiki_language) (Multani dialect).

I contribute to Hindi language translations in open source projects, thus making computers and software accessible to larger masses, and I am part of [Indlinux hindi team](https://indlinux.org).

# The poetic side
I [write poems](/poems) in English, Hindi and Punjabi. The poems are available at [/poems](/poems)

# The writing side
I write about anything mentioned above in [my posts](/posts).

# Beleifs
I regularly read and contribute to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org), thus making information accessible.

I belive that knowledge and information should be accessible to people, more than it was accessible to me, because knowledge is what empowers one.

# The Tech Side
The neurons in my brain are very crazy about logical stuff.  
I do and turn on computers and linux. I like programming and testing out random stuff on Linux.

## My system
I use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) on my system. A detailed description of applications and tools I use is available at [Tools](/tools).

# Contributions
All my contributions to software, translations, and Wikipedia are listed at [contributions](/contributions).
