vc sir ka app
====================
- sign up with google, with role (attendant, coordinator, supervisor) and employee id and name
- sign in leads to correct page according to user role

- if supervisor, has menu to select two things: attendance screen (can mark attendance of workers, will show only workers that come under that supervisor), overall status of checklists (jitni bhi checklists hain list view mein aayengi and unpe tap krne pe chech list dikhegi (table form mein) with fields like time last checked, name of worker, )

- if overall coordinator: attendance overview (copy from supervisor, but shows all workers or possibly club in form of headed by each supervisor), and checklist overview by a list view first

- if attendant, check lists and (if possible) their own attendance record
