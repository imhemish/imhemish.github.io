# Desktop environment or window managers

I primarily use Wayland.

- Generally, I use [GNOME](https://gnome.org) because I love its simplicity and design.
- Casually, you may see my driving [Sway](https://swaywm.org) or [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org); [wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots) is a cool project.

# Text editors

- I use [neovim](https://neovim.io) for quick editing in terminal,
- but I use [VS Codium](https://vscodium.com/) for projects spanning multiple files and actually coding something. I used to use VS Code earlier.
- I sometimes also use [Xed](https://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/xed), that is a part of [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com)'s [XApps](https://linuxmint-developer-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xapps.html), for quickly writing something or when I have to move around and copy something (I still don't know how to move stuff and copy in neovim or vim). Though I would mostly use GNOME apps, but I prefer Xed over Gnome Text Editor because I believe having a toolbar in Xed is good, and Xed also supports a tree sidebar for showing files.

# Music Players

- I download music (by very legal ways) and maintain playlists using .m3u files. I use [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org/) and [ncmpcppcpcppcppcpp](https://rybczak.net/ncmpcpp/) on my laptop. I sync these music files and playlists between my phone and laptop by either using Syncthing, or using [MEGA](https://mega.io) cloud storage.

I use something called "GoneMAD music player" on my phone, because it has got support for non-databased .m3u playlists and support for id3v2.4 tags with correct support for multiple 'ARTIST' fields.

I scrobble my music to [last.fm](https://last.fml), [libre.fm](https://libre.fm) and [listenbrainz.org](https://listenbrainz.org).

I also use Spotify for discovering music (by going to some song that I know, and then clicking 'Go to Song Radio'). I used to use Spotify Premium, with thierd party clients based on [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot), but I stopped using it, following the switch to offline music management.

I also use [Amberol](https://apps.gnome.org/en/app/io.bassi.Amberol/) for random music files. Emanuel Bassi and others have done great work on it.

# Archive manager

- Generally Nautilus (GNOME Files) just works fine with normal archives.
- File Roller (generic name: Archive Manager) when using GUI, for complext archives and others not supported by Nautilus.
- [unar](https://theunarchiver.com/command-line) in terminal because this can extract a lot of file types without learning separate commands for unzip, tar, etc.

# Notes

I prefer to just use markdown for notes, but I also do want the sync functionality. I use:

- [Paper](https://gitlab.com/posidon_software/paper) on laptop (libadwaita app)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) on Android

I sync their write directories either through [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) or MEGA cloud storage, and they work beautifully.

# Video player

Imagine not using [MPV](https://mpv.io)

# Screen Recording

- For quick recordings - [Kooha](https://apps.gnome.org/en/app/io.github.seadve.Kooha/)
- For high quality long recordings - [OBS](https://obsproject.com)

# Document Reader

Evince (generic name: Document Viewer)

# Fediverse

I currently only use Mastodon primarily, though I also have a pixelfed accounts. The clients I use are:

- [Tooth](https://github.com/GeopJr/Tooth) on laptop
- [Moshidon](https://github.com/LucasGGamerM/moshidon) on Android

# Browser

I have a bug in my mind which keeps asking me to switch back and forth between Firefox and Chrome/Chromium. I am  currently using Firefox on mobile, and Chromium on laptop. Three months ago, I used to use Firefox on desktop, and  6 months, I used to use Chromium both on laptop and mobile.

# Office tools

Why would a programer even need them? So I don't even keep LibreOffice. When there is an absolute need to use a Office suite, I would just use Google Docs, and I also have [Abiword](https://www.abisource.com/) and [Gnumeric](https://gnumeric.org) installed.

# Torrent client

I used to use [QBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), and it worked great. But, now I use [Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) just because of my affection for GTK.

# RSS and Atom Feeds

I use the miniflux instance at [https://tildevarsh.in](https://tildevarsh.in). The clients I use for it:

- [Newsflash](https://apps.gnome.org/en/app/com.gitlab.newsflash/) on Laptop
- [Read You](https://github.com/Ashinch/ReadYou) on Android (via the Fever API structure)

# Image viewer

- Currently using Eye of GNOME (eog)
- but looking forward to use [Loupe](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Incubator/loupe) when it lands in GNOME Core to replace eog.

# Backup software

I use [Pika Backup](https://apps.gnome.org/en/app/org.gnome.World.PikaBackup/) to backup my stuff to two places: [BorgBase](https://borgbase.com) and my pendrive. (Pika Backup is a frontend to [Borg Backup](https://borgbackup.org))

# Matrix Clients

- [Nheko](https://nheko-reborn.github.io/) on Laptop
- [SchildiChat](https://schildi.chat/android/) on Android

Though I am looking forward to use [Fractal](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal) when its development branch starts supporting spaces.

# Mail client

- [Geary](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary) on Laptop
- K-9 mail on Android

# Other miscalleneous tools

- [Decoder](https://apps.gnome.org/app/com.belmoussaoui.Decoder/) for scanning QR codes on Laptop (libadwaita app)
- [GNOME Characters](https://apps.gnome.org/app/org.gnome.Characters/) for adding emojis or unicode symbols
- [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com)'s [Warpinator](https://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/warpinator) on Laptop and [unofficial Warpinator](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/slowscript.warpinator/) for Android to share files across phone and laptop when on same network
- [Gtranslator](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gtranslator) for translating software UI's into Hindi
- [Mousai](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.seadve.Mousai) for identifying music, right through desktop.
