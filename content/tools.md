# Desktop environment

I primarily use Wayland.

- Generally, I use [GNOME](https://gnome.org) because I love its simplicity and design.
- I used to use [Sway](https://swaywm.org) and [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org); [wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots) is a cool project.

# Text editors

- I use [neovim](https://neovim.io) for quick editing in terminal,
- but I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for projects spanning multiple files and actually coding something.
- Casually GNOME Text Editor (or simply Text Editor) for quick things.

# Music Players

- I use Youtube Music (because of its vast library).
- I tried the 'keeping offline music' thing with mpd, syncthings and stuff, but was not viable for me.

# Archive manager

- Generally Nautilus (GNOME Files) just works fine with normal archives.
- File Roller (or Archive Manager) when using GUI, for complext archives and others not supported by Nautilus.

# Notes

I prefer to just use markdown for notes, but I also do want the sync functionality. I use:

- [QOwnNotes](https://www.qownnotes.org/) on laptop
- [Markor](https://github.com/gsantner/markor) on Android
- [Rnote](https://github.com/flxzt/rnote) for handwritten notes via Pen

I sync their write directories either through [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) or MEGA cloud storage, and they work beautifully.

# Todo app

I use [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) format to take notes. I use:

- My own libadwaita app, [Kaar](https://github.com/imhemish/kaar) on Laptop
- [Ntodotxt](https://github.com/tmaegel/ntodotxt/) on Android

# Video player

Imagine not using [MPV](https://mpv.io)

# Screen Recording

- For quick recordings - [Kooha](https://apps.gnome.org/en/app/io.github.seadve.Kooha/)
- For high quality long recordings - [OBS](https://obsproject.com)

# Document Reader

Evince (generic name: Document Viewer)

# Fediverse

I currently only use Mastodon primarily, though I also have a pixelfed account. The clients I use are:

- [Tuba](https://github.com/GeopJr/Tuba) on laptop
- [Moshidon](https://github.com/LucasGGamerM/moshidon) on Android

# Browser

I tried to switch to Firefox and ungoogled-chromium. But, I am back at plain old Google Chrome.

# Office tools

One and only [LibreOffice](https://libreoffice.org)

# Torrent client

I used to use [QBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), and it worked great. But, now I use [Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) just because of my affection for GTK.

# RSS and Atom Feeds

I use the miniflux instance of my friend. The clients I use for it:

- [Newsflash](https://apps.gnome.org/en/app/com.gitlab.newsflash/) on Laptop
- [FluxNews](https://github.com/KevinCFechtel/FluxNews) on Android

# Image viewer

- [Loupe](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Incubator/loupe) (The new GNOME Image viewer)

# Backup software

I use [Pika Backup](https://apps.gnome.org/en/app/org.gnome.World.PikaBackup/) to backup my stuff to two places: [BorgBase](https://borgbase.com) and my external hard disk. (Pika Backup is a frontend to [Borg Backup](https://borgbackup.org))

# Matrix Clients

- [FluffyChat](https://schildi.chat/android/) on Android

# Video Editor

I keep both [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org) and [OpenShot](https://openshot.org) handy.

# Other miscalleneous tools

- [Decoder](https://apps.gnome.org/app/com.belmoussaoui.Decoder/) for scanning QR codes on Laptop (libadwaita app)
- [GNOME Characters](https://apps.gnome.org/app/org.gnome.Characters/) for adding emojis or unicode symbols
- [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com)'s [Warpinator](https://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/warpinator) on Laptop and [unofficial Warpinator](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/slowscript.warpinator/) for Android to share files across phone and laptop when on same network
- [Gtranslator](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gtranslator) for translating software UI's into Hindi
