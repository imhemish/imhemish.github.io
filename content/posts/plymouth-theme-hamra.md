*Hamara Linux* was/is a India based linux distribution. It is in pretty dormant stage now (Even the site is down for some time).

I asked [Chirag Sukhala](https://itsmeh.com/chirag_sukhala) what is even the need of such a Linux distribution which gives you Indic languages preinstalled when you can just install Indic languages in pretty much any popular linux distro 
<!-- more --> like [Debian](https://debian.org) or [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) or [Arch](https://archlinux.org) with just one package (in Arch, it is called ```ttf-indic-otf```.) To my surprise, he had an amazing answer, "the wallpapers with Indian touch, and the overall look of the distribution is good." Themeing is a pretty fair reason for a distro to exist.

Well, I would have to dig into archives to extract wallpapers from their ISO, but I found that their Plymouth theme (Plymouth is a program installed by many distros to give you a boot animation) is in Debian repositories.

Being an Arch Linux user, I created a PKGBUILD and an [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org) (Arch Linux User Repository) package for it. It is called 'plymouth-theme-hamara'. So, now any Arch Linux user can enjoy that boot animation.

Take a look at the package here: [plymouth-theme-hamara](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plymouth-theme-hamara)
