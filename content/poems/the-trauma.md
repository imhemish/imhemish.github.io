Rethinking about regretted life choices, I wrote this:
<!-- more -->

Imagine someone asking the same thing over and over,  
and your self esteem getting lower and lower;  
your mind is supposed to regret and think everything is over,  
while you just not care what's gonna happen over;

But still people ask how your progress is going,  
and all these lies which I am just vowing;  
just make it worse and ever-growing,  
to this trauma, I am bowing and bowing;

Feeling left behind when everyone is moving ahead,  
woud I ever be able to get a comforting bed;  
would I be an outcast for the mistake I wed,  
or would this distress just make me internally dead?

How many times I have thought about it all,  
I wasn't doing what exactly was my goal;  
then why did I choose that for my soul,  
but now it's too late to think of control;

All I can do is face the trauma now,  
or just stop inventing lies which I vow;  
to the people around me to whom I bow,  
this is enough and I should just now say ciao.
